# ChocoPy compiler written in Rust

![Rust](https://github.com/wwylele/chocopy-rs/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

This is a course project but they want us to write in java. I want to try something else so I am making this second implementation.

The `chocopy-wars` submodule links to the java implementation.

# ChocoPy compiler written in Rust

![Rust](https://github.com/wwylele/chocopy-rs/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

> [ChocoPy](https://chocopy.org/) is a programming language designed for classroom use in undergraduate compilers courses. ChocoPy is a restricted subset of Python 3, which can easily be compiled to a target such as RISC-V. The language is fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics. ChocoPy is used to teach CS 164 at UC Berkeley. ChocoPy has been designed by Rohan Padhye and Koushik Sen, with substantial contributions from Paul Hilfinger.

So this was a course project for me. But I also want to try something else, so here it is, a second implementation that
 - is written in ~~java~~ rust,
 - has a parser ~~built using JFlex and CUP~~ hand-written,
 - targets ~~RISC-V~~ x86-64, and
 - produces ~~object files that runs in a simluator~~ executables that runs directly in Windows or Linux.

This project is licensed under [MIT License](LICENSE). Test case files under [`chocopy-rs/test/original`](chocopy-rs/test/original) are from the original course project, with their own copyright notice in the directory.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for some design detail.

## Dependency

chocopy-rs needs a linker and some basic libraries to produce native executable:
 - Windows: Visual Studio (full version or build tools only), Windows SDK
 - Linux: GCC, glibc

Also make sure that `libchocopy_rs_std.a`(Linux) / `chocopy_rs_std.lib`(Windows) is in the same directory as `chocopy-rs` executable.

These are not needed if you only need chocopy-rs to produce AST JSON or object file.

## Usage

```
# compile source file input.py to executable output.exe
chocopy-rs input.py output.exe

# compile source file input.py to object file output.o
chocopy-rs input.py output.o --obj

# parse source file and output untyped AST JSON to STDOUT
chocopy-rs input.py --ast

# parse and check source file and output typed AST JSON to STDOUT
chocopy-rs input.py --typed

```

## Garbage collection

chocopy-rs implements simple garbage collection by reference counting. Just like all reference counting, this will fail to collect garbage that contains reference cycle. In such case, the compiled program will report memory on exit.

## Standard library

All ChocoPy programs are linked against a small standard library `chocopy_rs_std`. The library contains the implementation for built-in functions, object (de)allocation, and error reporting.

The standard library also provides the program entry point `main`, which directly calls into the main procedure `$chocopy_main` from the compiled object. Doing so is to avoid conflict when the ChocoPy program contains a user-defined function named `main`, which in the current implementation will be a local symbol only visible to the compiled object itself.

## Symbol naming convention
 - The main procedure is named `$chocopy_main`.
 - The global variable section is named `$global`.
 - Global functions use their function names directly as symbol names.
 - Constructors use type names as symbol names.
 - Destructors use `<TypeName>.$dtor` as symbol names.
 - Methods use `<TypeName>.<FuncName>` as symbol names.
 - Prototypes use `<TypeName>.$proto` as symbol names.
 - Nested functions use `<ParentSymbolName>.<FuncName>` as symbol names.
 - Functions from the standard library all have symbol names starts with `$`, except for the program entry point `main`.

## Calling convention

chocopy-rs compiles program using the following calling convention:
 - push all arguments to the stack. The rightmost argument is placed at the highest address.
 - pass static chain pointer in `R10` if it is a nested function.
 - ensure the stack pointer is aligned at 8 mod 16 at the beginning of a function.
 - pass return value in `RAX`.
 - caller restores stack.
 - `RAX`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `RSI`, `RDI`, `R8`, `R9`, `R10`, `R11` are volatile across function call.

All generated procedures are called using this calling convention, except for the followings:

 - the main procedure `$chocopy_main`
 - standard library functions
 - generated destructor.

 These functions are called using platform's default C ABI (System V ABI for linux, and Microsoft Windows ABI for Windows).
